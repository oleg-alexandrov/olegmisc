PolyView is a free polygon viewer. The PolyView documentation is at

https://sites.google.com/site/olegalexandrov/polyview

To compile PolyView from source, the Qt 4 development libraries need to
be installed. They can can be obtained in Ubuntu by typing

apt-get install qmake

The next steps are:

cd gui
qmake polyview.pro 
make

The 'qmake' command will generate a makefile which whill be used by
'make' to build the executable. The 'gui' directory has a sample
makefile as generated by 'qmake'.
