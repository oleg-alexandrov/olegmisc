"1. Features of polyView accessible from the GUI\n"
"   --------------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"File menu\n"
"* Load a file in addition to existing files\n"
"* Save the polygons as one file\n"
"* Save the polygons as individual files\n"
"* Overwrite the existing polygons\n"
"\n"
"View menu\n"
"* Choose which files to show/hide\n"
"* Zoom and pan\n"
"* Reset the view to contain all polygons with a small padding\n"
"* Change the order in which the polygons are displayed\n"
"* Show/hide annotations\n"
"* Show polygons as filled with color\n"
"* Show vertices as points\n"
"* Show the index of each vertex\n"
"* Show the layer ids (if present)\n"
"\n"
"Edit menu\n"
"* Undo and redo\n"
"* Create a polygon with integer vertices and edge angles multiple \n"
"  of 45 degrees\n"
"* Enforce integer vertices and edge angles multiple of 45 degrees\n"
"* Create a polygon with arbitrary angles\n"
"\n"
"Transform menu\n"
"* Translate/rotate/scale polygons\n"
"\n"
"Selection menu\n"
"* Create a highlight (the polygons in the highlight are automatically\n"
"  selected and copied to a buffer)\n"
"* Cut the polygons to the current highlight\n"
"* Delete the selected polygons\n"
"* Paste the selected polygons\n"
"* Move the selected polygons (use Shift-Mouse)\n"
"* Deselect all polygons and delete all highlights\n"
"\n"
"Grid menu\n"
"* Show/hide the grid\n"
"* Enforce that edges have angles multiple of 45 degrees and snap the \n"
"  vertices to the grid\n"
"* Set the grid size\n"
"* Set the grid linewidth\n"
"* Set the grid color\n"
"\n"
"Diff menu\n"
"* Change the colors of polygons so that polygons from different files \n"
"  have different colors\n"
"* Enter diff mode (a mode in which two similar polygon files can be \n"
"  compared)\n"
"* Show the next/previous difference between given two given polygon \n"
"  files (starting with the largest difference)\n"
"\n"
"Options menu\n"
"* Set the linewidth of polygon edges\n"
"* Set the background color\n"
"\n"
"Right-click menu\n"
"* Save/show mark at point\n"
"* Use the nm scale when printing the coordinates of vertices \n"
"  (assuming that the polygons are at the dbu scale)\n"
"* Create a polygon with integer vertices and edge angles multiple \n"
"  of 45 degrees\n"
"* Enforce integer vertices and edge angles multiple of 45 degrees\n"
"* Create a polygon with arbitrary angles\n"
"* Delete the polygon at mouse cursor\n"
"* Enter align mode (a mode in which, given two polygon files, the \n"
"  second polygon file is kept fixed, while the first one can be \n"
"  interactively shifted using Shift-Mouse and rotated/flipped from \n"
"  the right-click menu until it aligns to the second one)\n"
"* Enter move polygons mode (use Shift-Mouse to move a polygon)\n"
"* Enter move vertices mode (use Shift-Mouse to move a vertex)\n"
"* Enter move edges mode (use Shift-Mouse to move an edge)\n"
"* Insert a vertex on the edge closest to the mouse cursor\n"
"* Delete the vertex closest to the mouse cursor\n"
"* Copy the polygon closest to the mouse cursor\n"
"* Paste the polygon closest to the mouse cursor\n"
"* Reverse the orientation of the polygon closest to the mouse cursor\n"

"2. Features of polyView accessible from the command line\n"
