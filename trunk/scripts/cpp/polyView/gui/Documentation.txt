Features of polyView accessible from the GUI

File menu
* Load a file in addition to existing files
* Save the polygons as one file
* Save the polygons as individual files
* Overwrite the existing polygons

View menu
* Choose which files to view and which to hide
* Zoom and pan
* Reset view
* Change the order in which the polygons are displayed
* Show/hide annotations
* Show polygons as filled with color
* Show vertices as points
* Show the index of each vertex
* Show the layer ids (if present)

Edit menu
* Undo and redo
* Create a polygon with integer vertices and edge angles multiple of 45 degrees
* Enforce integer vertices and edge angles multiple of 45 degrees
* Create a polygon with arbitrary angles

Transform menu
* Translate/rotate/scale polygons

Selection menu
* Create a highlight (the polygons in the highlight are automatically
  selected and copied in a buffer)
* Cut the polygons to the current highlight
* Delete selected polygons
* Paste selected polys
* Move selected polys (use Shift-Mouse)
* Deselect all polygons and delete all highlights

Grid menu
* Show/hide the grid
* Enforce that edges have angles multiple of 45 degrees and snap the vertices to grid
* Set the grid size
* Set the grid linewidth
* Set the grid color

Diff menu
* Change the colors of polygons so that polygons in different files 
  have different colors
* Enter diff mode (a mode in which two similar polygon files can be 
  compared)
* Show the next/previous difference between given polygon files 
  (starting with the largest difference)

Options menu
* Set the line width of polygon edges
* Set the background color

Right-click menu

* Save/show mark at point
* Use nm scale (assuming polygons are at dbu scale)
* Create a polygon with integer vertices and edge angles multiple of 45 degrees
* Enforce integer vertices and edge angles multiple of 45 degrees
* Create a polygon with arbitrary angles
* Delete the polygon at mouse cursor
* Enter align mode (a mode in which, given two polygon files, the second polygon file
  is kept fixed, while the first one can be interactively shifted using Shift-Mouse
  and rotated/flipped from the right-click menu until it aligns to the second one).
* Enter move polygons mode (use Shift-Mouse to move a polygon)
* Enter move vertices mode (use Shift-Mouse to move a vertex)
* Insert a vertex on the edge closest to the mouse cursor
* Delete the vertex closest to the mouse cursor
* Copy the polygon closest to the mouse cursor
* Paste the polygon closest to the mouse cursor
* Reverse the orientation of the polygon closest to the mouse cursor

Features of polyView accessible from the command line

polyView will open simultaneously all polygon files supplied as inputs
on the command line. Various command line options can modify how the
polygons are displayed.

-geo[metry] (for example 1000x800)   The window size in pixels

-bg | -backgroundColor <color name>  Color of the background (default is black)

-c | -color <color name>             All polygons after this option will show
                                     up in the given color

-fs | -fontSize <integer>            The text font size

-lw | -lineWidth <integer>           All polygons after this option will show
                                     up with given linewidth

-p | -points                         All polygons after this option will show
                                     up as points (a subsequent -p option undoes
                                     the previous one)

-cp | -closedPoly                    All polygons after this option will show 
                                     up as closed (the last vertex is connected
                                     to the first vertex)

-nc | -nonClosedPoly                 Interpret the vertices as belonging to a 
                                     polygonal line rather than to a polygon

-f | -filledPoly                     All polygons after this option will show
                                     up as filled

-nf | -nonFilledPoly                 All polygons after this option will not 
                                     show up as filled

-grid on | off                       Turn on/off the grid display

-gridSize <integer>                  Grid size in pixels

-gridWidth <integer>                 Grid width in pixels

-gridColor <color>                   Grid color
