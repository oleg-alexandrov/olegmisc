GM_20191019 - Lots of jitter work for Grand Mesa, with many notes. Archived on lfe.

Good stereo data. See inside each dir for a readme:

 - lronac_topo
 - CTX 

The following contain final SfS results only:

hermite_a.tar spudis.tar nobile.tar 

Other datasets have intermediate results and are named similarly.

The dataset nobile_1.tar has both latest results and intermediate results.

Note that nobile and nobile_1 are actually two different sites.

Also note the much bigger nobile_2.tar dataset.

grand_mesa_skysat: SkySat. Grand Mesa Site. Very good dataset for studying large scale bundle adjustment with notes. Archived on lfe as /u/oalexan1/projects/grand_mesa_skysat.tar.

change_proposal: SkySat. Uluru site. Very good dataset for studying large scale bundle adjustment with notes. Archived on lfe as /u/oalexan1/projects/change_proposal.tar.
