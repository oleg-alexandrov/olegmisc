The files of the form dot*el contain pieces of lisp code, which get
htmlized and included in the web pages. They also form the basis of my
XEmacs distribution (see test_emacs). Thus, if I want to make changes,
all I need is change those lisp files, and the changes will (after
running the my-htmlize command from XEmacs, and the script from
test_emacs) propagate to the web pages and the xemacs distribution,
keeping them in sync.
