"<b>PolyView</b> is a free and open source software program for Linux designed to quickly load and visualize multiple sets of polygon files from the command line. It can zoom and pan, show polygons as edges, points, and filled, display text labels, print the coordinates of vertices and measure distances, change the order in which polygons are displayed, choose which polygons to show, etc.<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"PolyView can also do basic polygon editing, such as creating/deleting/moving/rotating/scaling polygons, adding/removing/modifying vertices, as well as cutting polygons to a box.<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"PolyView accepts a lengthy list of command line arguments, and the view can be also manipulated interactively from the GUI once the polygons are loaded. A complete list of features and functions is shown below.<br>\n"
"<br>\n"
"PolyView is implemented in C++ using Qt 4. Its source code is freely available under the MIT license and can be used for any purpose, academic or commercial.\n"

"<h2>Documentation</h2>\n"
"<h3>File format</h3>\n"
"PolyView was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.xgraph.org/xgraph.html\">xgraph</a>,\n"
"and it uses xgraph's file format, in which the x and y coordinates of \n"
"each polygon are stored as two columns in a plain text file followed by \n"
"the \"NEXT\" statement. Here is a sample polygon file storing a rectangle \n"
"and a triangle.\n"
"</div>\n"
"\n"

"</div>\n"

"Notice that the first vertex of each polygon is repeated again before \n"
"the \"NEXT\" statement, to signal to the viewer that the polygon is \n"
"closed. \n"

"<h3>Features of PolyView accessible from the GUI</h3>\n"
"<h4>Mouse buttons</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<ul><li>The left mouse button snaps to the closest polygon vertex and prints its coordinates. A subsequent click also prints the distance from the previous vertex to the current one.</li>\n"
"<li>The middle mouse button prints the coordinates of where the mouse clicked, without snapping to the closest vertex.</li>\n"
"<li>Dragging the mouse from lower-left to upper-right zooms in, and doing it in reverse zooms out.</li>\n"
"<li>Dragging the mouse while keeping the Control key pressed creates a highlight which can be used to cut the polygons to the highlight or to paste/move/delete them.\n"
"</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<h4>Command box</h4>\n"
"<ul><li>Many GUI operations (such as zoom) echo their action as a command in the terminal used to start PolyView. That command can be pasted in the command box at the bottom of the PolyView GUI to reproduce the original operation. This provides a basic level of scripting and reproducibility.</li></ul>\n"
